            <h3>Fonts</h3>
            <h3>Raleway</h3>
            <p>Raleway is a unique, yet simple and clean typeface that pushes its modernality 
                and stylistic ques very well. Because JBL is pushing more towards the younger audiences
                and as well as it is always experimenting and challenging for the better, Raleway typeface will
                dissolve well with the company identity. 

                <br><br>

                I have used different thickness varients of the Raleway typeface for Headers, Sub-Headers, Subjects, and Paragraphs.

            <h2>H2 - Used for Headers</h2>
            <h3>H3 - Used for Sub-Headers</h3>
            <h4>H4 - Used for Subjects</h4>
            <p>P - Used for Paragraphs</p>

            <h3>Orbitron</h3>
            <p>
                Orbitron is a futuristic and geometric typeface characterized by clean lines,
                 sharp angles, and bold, condensed letters. Inspired by science fiction and space
                  exploration, it exudes a modern and technological vibe, perfect for projects seeking
                   a sleek, forward-thinking aesthetic.

                   <br><br>

                I have used Orbitron typeface for the titles of the website to give it a futuristic look. JBL Canada, Our Products, and Checkout.

            <h3>Color palette</h3>
            <h4>Hex: #ff6600 | RGB: 255, 102, 0</h4>
            <p>JBL currently uses #ff6600 (orange) theme color, however, addition of calm black color would complement the bright orange theme color well.
                <br><br> 
                The Orange color (#ff6600) is used for accents and interaction points to help users to focus on the important aspects, and as well as to help 
                guiding them to the interactions.
                <br><br>
                The Black color (#000000) is used for the website background color, to help accentuate the use of the white letterings and the orange cue points.
             </p>

            <h3>Potential imagery and, or, art direction</h3>
            <p>
                Simple website that carries dark themed background with large white panels with orange text accents.
                <br><br> Showcase products in large panels that emphasize its design with images, its name, price, short product descriptions, <br>
                and who the product is for (amateurs, professionals, indoor, outdoor).

                <br><br>
                
                The font combinations will be one type of typeface with multiple varients:
                Thin 100, ExtraLight 200, Regular 400, SemiBold 600, Bold 700, and Black 900.
                
                <br><br>

                The different varients of the typeface will be used to incorporate the site with 
                different looks for different parts of the headings, and be used to highlight important
                areas. The titles and headings will be using thicker levels of the typeface
                to emphasize the hierarchy against paragraphs.

                <br><br>

                The bright orange theme color (#ff6600) will be used to highlight buttons and as
                focusing points of the website. Buttons will be in this color to put emphasis
                on them, as well as highlighting field inputs, its font color, and border for images. 
                Some aspects of the color use will change its color when interacted.

                <br><br>

                Stock images of the products will be used to decor the front-page of the site, which 
                are clickable to expand into detailed descriptions with prices.
